<title>Inadequate street lighting in Mill Street Prestbury Cheltenham, 3rd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8622266</link>
<description>I was walking up from the Burgage at 6.00pm on Friday 19th December and noticed one street light in the whole street which is very long. When I was nearly outside the Plough Inn I literally could not see in front of my face..it was so dark that I fell heavily ..I badly skinned both my knees and bruised my left leg..they are still healing. I was going to see St Mary&amp;#39;s Choir but the garden was far too crowded and I was shaken up. I went home with my dog and didn&amp;#39;t leave the house over the weekend. The street lighting is totally inadequate outside the public house..their garden was well lit where the choir was but there were far too many people there. I would like you to survey this street and report your findings to me...it could have been more serious if I had fell into the street with passing traffic. It was witnessed by my friend at that time and it happened at 18.10pm..
