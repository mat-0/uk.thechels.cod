<title>Walking this track from the Staverton direction, there is no sign or obvious physical feature to indicate that the footpath diverts off of the track, 11th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8897343</link>
<description>The footpath from Staverton follows a track and is apparently supposed to divert off of the track in the direction of the B4634, but because this is not obvious at all, it is very easy to continue on down the track (where it is no longer legally a right of way) and end up on private land. A signpost should really be installed to prevent accidental trespassing&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Boddington Road, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8897343&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>3rd time reporting this!!!!!, 11th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8896265</link>
<description>See ref 8113611 and 8375578. There has been no information sent to us with regards to this and it has not been resolved however it has been closed. In very heavy rainfall the driveway will flood and flood in to the house and the next door neighbours property unless the sandbags are out. This has happened a few times in the last few years but luckily we were able to stop it. Please can this be addressed asap. At least try to actually contact me rather than continuing to close the tickets without explaining what is happening.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8896265.0.jpeg?fe0bbea7&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Barnmeadow Road, Winchcombe, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8896265&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
