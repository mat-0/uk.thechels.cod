<title>Road surface deterioration dangerous to cyclists, 1st December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8487073</link>
<description>The nearside of the road cycling down Harp Hill is deteriorated with multiple potholes and surface defects. This is approached on a bike at speed and is dangerous to cyclists. If you hit the uneven surface on a bike you risk losing control. If you avoid the surface problems you are pushed out into the middle of the road with fast moving traffic. Please could you resurface this piece of road in one even continuous patch. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8487073.0.jpeg?2fe744e1&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Harp Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8487073&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Overgrown Trees and Hedging, 1st December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8486191</link>
<description>Good Morning, I live at 38 Lauriston Park, The Park, Cheltenham, GL50 2QL We have a large centre island with various trees and hedge’s which over time has become very overgrown, the trees have grown extremely high and overhang. Please can you arrange for an inspection to see that they are safe and could be cut back. Neighbours park their cars around this island so would need to be informed to move them should any work be scheduled, our close has a walk and cycle path which is very busy particularly at School times with many vehicles going around the island I am concerned that the restrictive vision could result in an accident, especially with cyclists. I hope you will investigate this issue as a matter of urgency.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kind regards&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Colin James Pulman.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 102, Shurdington Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8486191&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
