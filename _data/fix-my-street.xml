<title>Huge plant pots on carriageway., 1st February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8813378</link>
<description>You pro forma list of issues isn&amp;#39;t specific enough to accurately identify the issue-I have chosen the nearest description I could find. There is a row of large plant pots on the carriageway outside the properties Water Hatch House and Hillview. These obstruct the already narrow road at a 90° bend. Please arrange their removal.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8813378.0.jpeg?2b65e1db&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Silk Mill Lane, Winchcombe, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8813378&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Is 24 Shelley Road, Cheltenham, Gl51 7DR. I’m sorry I didn’t add it to the most recent email, as it was on the previous complaint I had sent. I assumed someone may have connected the two. This most resent hole, has now developed large pieces of stones, that are being catapulted into the road and onto the pavement. If one hits someone, it could be potentially serious. My son in law picked some up yesterday, as one clipped their car, luckily no damage, as he was slowing down, not speeding as some do. I have already reported this, but I couldn’t add my address to original post, Kind regards Margaret Finch, 1st February</title>
