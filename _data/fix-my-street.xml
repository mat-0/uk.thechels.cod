<title>Impossible to avoid huge pothole in carriagway on bridge, 21st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8739146</link>
<description>On apex of humpback railway bridge in the left hand carriageway as you head from badgeworth towards arle court roundabout. Pothole is so large now that it cannot be avoided. Already causing vehicle damage despite several reports on this platform. It is now going to cause a road accident due to location of pothole, as drivers are moving into the oncoming carriageway on a blind apex to avoid it, or being thrown into the oncoming carriageway after hitting it when driving in the dark. GET IT FIXED! Dont rely on having photographs as this is a very dangerous section of the road to expect anyone to stop and take photographs at, just fix it as its been getting worse for months!&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Badgeworth Road, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8739146&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Flooding/ Poor road surface, 21st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8738598</link>
<description>Between Gotherington railway bridge and turn off to Dixton.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Even though there has been rain in the last 24 hours, when there hasn’t been this section of road takes ages to drain as there seems to be no drainage. It is a major hazard as cars drive in the middle of the road where theres some surface still visible to avoid the dangerous surface below the water. It really needs looking into asap as there’s going to be an accident sooner or later. The whole Gretton/ Gotherington Road needs resurfacing as there’s multiple issues.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gretton Road, Prescott, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8738598&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Large pothole on 70mph road not visible in the dark. Still not fixed, 21st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8737909</link>
<description>Went straight over this dangerous pothole today (not signposted or even marked) causing a puncture and potential damage to my suspension. Came here to report to find out the council has been aware of the issue for over a week and nothing has been done to even make other drivers aware of it? Luckily all that happened to me was hearing a large bang but could’ve easily ended having much worse damage to my car or had I swerved at the speed the road permits, a crash. I will be filing a claim against the council and I suggest that anyone else does too because the fact that it is taking this long to even put white lines around a pothole is absolutely absurd.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Tewkesbury Road, Deerhurst, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8737909&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
