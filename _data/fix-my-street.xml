<title>3rd time reporting this!!!!!, 11th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8896265</link>
<description>See ref 8113611 and 8375578. There has been no information sent to us with regards to this and it has not been resolved however it has been closed. In very heavy rainfall the driveway will flood and flood in to the house and the next door neighbours property unless the sandbags are out. This has happened a few times in the last few years but luckily we were able to stop it. Please can this be addressed asap. At least try to actually contact me rather than continuing to close the tickets without explaining what is happening.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8896265.0.jpeg?fe0bbea7&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Barnmeadow Road, Winchcombe, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8896265&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Parking area opposite the steps on The Terrace, Winchcombe. first two parking bays on the left, facing car park with wall behind you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These two Blue Badge bays have been poorly marked for a long time and now have no marking, with the result that they are used by all. This year I observed cones put out for work on 16th January and today 11.Feb the work is still to be done. During Nov/Dec last year the area was coned off, but no work was undertaken. These bays and those outside Morrisons are the only ones on level ground into the town&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Abbey Terrace, Winchcombe, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8895680&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
