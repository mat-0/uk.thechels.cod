<title>Glebe Road Prestbury roadworks and flooding repairs., 27th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8473253</link>
<description>Glebe Road Prestbury roadworks and flooding repairs have done immense damage to the road, the kerbs and the verges. The workmen have been intermittent in attendance and leave the road in a terrible state, I cannot walk around the green without slipping on the piles of mud and the mess that has been created. It is not accepatable and none of the residents is clear about what has been achieved or whether the green, the verges and the kerbs will be put in a good state once finished. Nobody clears up at the end of each day and in fact no staff have turned up today the 27th November 2025. Its not looking good.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 8, Glebe Road, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8473253&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree is damaged problem, 27th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8472786</link>
<description>&amp;#10;We have had a structural engineer out to our house to look at cracking in the internal and external walls. It is the view of the engineer that there is some shifting of foundations, due to the clay on which these houses are built, and the dry summer we have had. However, he also said the large tree outside our property will be contributing to the dryness as the roots will be sucking up the moisture in the ground. He recommended that the tree be attended to; trimming or crowning it would reduce its water requirements and help our situation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I believe, as the tree is in the pavement, so to speak, it falls to Highways to help us out, if at all possible?&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8472786&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
