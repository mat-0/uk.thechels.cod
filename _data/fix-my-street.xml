<title>Numerous potholes, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667907</link>
<description>There are numerous potholes now in Village Road from Newdawn Place north to the bus shelter. They are gerowing with each rain storm as evidenced by the amount of debris being thrown up with the frosty conditions followed heavy rain. This issue is being exacerbated by the amount of gutter flooding due to blocked drains, which has on numerous occasions extended a full third of the way across the road. this is making the eastern footpath unsafe for pedestrians.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 95, Village Road, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667907&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Gravel walk has numerous issues, the road has collapsed in many places including a very large pothole near the substation and damage to the sewer chamber which has just been filled with soft tarmac. This will not solve the issue with the chamber. The road has collapsed near verges down the entirety of the road due to the use of heavy building machinery, 11th January</title>

<title>Faded white line across entrance to Hambrook St / dangerous junction, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667584</link>
<description>The previous white access line has worn away therefore people tend to park too close to the junction. This limits visibility and has caused multiple near collisions when one car has to blindly pull out of hambrook street as another is driving 30mph down Ryeworth Road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8667584.0.jpeg?48e27eb0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Hambrook Street, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667584&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>2 kerb wedges have been put outside 38 swallow crescent to allow them to bump the kerb (which isn&amp;#39;t a dropped kerb) and park on their front garden.
