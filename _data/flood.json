While levels have dropped further up in the Pen Mill and Ilchester areas, river and drain levels are still high in the lowland areas around Long Load and Huish Episcopi. Floodwater remains in the Moors, such as around Long Load, Wet Moor and Huish Episcopi. A band of heavy persistent rain is forecast from this evening, Monday 08 December 2025, through to about midday tomorrow, which will cause further flooding impacts and sustain this Alert. This will cause rivers in the upper catchments to rise again and bring fresh flows down the River Yeo and into the Moors. Drier weather is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday. We will continue to monitor the situation and will issue further alerts or warnings if necessary. We are checking defences, bridges, culverts and screens. We will pump when river levels allow. Take care and avoid walking, cycling or driving through flood water. Act on your flood plan if you haven't already. This message will be updated by 12:00PM on 09 December 2025 or as the situation changes.\n",
