- Huge pothole has opened up again. Over 10 people have burst tyres now including hotel guests, staff and village locals. You cannot dodge it as the road is too narrow, and now I myself have burst a tyre today. The water runs over the road when raining and hides the large patch of badly repaired holes so impossible to see and avoid. It’s close to being an emergency now and cannot emphasise enough how bad it has gotten in the last two weeks. Maybe someone needs to drive down there to drive through the hole to see for themselves how bad it is. With the other back roads to cowley being closed for various reasons, this is the only access road to the village. The road is surprisingly busy and needs attention., 21st January :- [8737713](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8737713)
