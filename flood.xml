      <title>Warning no longer in force: Upper Bristol Avon area</title>
      <description>There is no longer a threat of flooding, though standing water and debris may still remain. 
Weather conditions are expected to improve and no further flooding is expected.   
We will continue to monitor the situation and will issue further alerts or warnings if necessary.   
If you have been evacuated only return to your property once the emergency services have advised that it is safe to do so. Never drive through flood water,  just 30cm of fast flowing water is enough to move your car.
