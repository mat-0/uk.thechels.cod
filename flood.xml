      <title>Warning no longer in force: River Leadon catchment</title>
      <description>There is no longer a threat of flooding, though standing water and debris may still remain. 
Weather conditions are expected to improve and no further flooding is expected.  
We will continue to monitor the situation and will issue further alerts or warnings if necessary.   
Never drive through flood water,  just 30cm of fast flowing water is enough to move your car. Stay away from floodwater - it contains hidden dangers such as open manhole covers, sewage and chemicals.
